				<h3>Our Story</h3>
				<p>Sam and Stella were on a date.  It was their second date; third if you count the walk they took to the Prudential Center for cookies at Paradise Bakery; fourth if you count the banana Stella brought Sam while he was working late at the library.  

				<p>Sam knew Stella liked him.  A couple weeks before, Stella's roommate Cherylynn had made it all but perfectly clear:</p>

				<%= image_tag "ourStory1.jpg", :class => "story1", :alt => "they definitely like each other" %>

				<div class="quote">
					<p>Sam: Does Stella like me?</p>
					<p>Cher: I don't knoooooooow. You should ask herrrrrrrrrrrr.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Stella knew Sam liked her. A couple nights before, he flat out told her.</p>
				<div class="quote">
					<p>Sam: I like you a lot.</p>
					<p>Stella: I like you a lot.</p>
					<p>Sam: ...Better get back to campus.</p>
					<p>Stella: {He's a coward}</p>
					<p>Sam: {I'm a coward}</p>
				</div>

				<p>So there they were, in a second-floor vegan Thai restaurant in Boston's Chinatown. Whatever they talked about was probably pretty plain.</p>

				<p>Then Stella did something that, to her, was perfectly ordinary. She squeezed a lemon into her water and then ran her lemon-soaked fingers through her hair.</p>

				<div class="quote">
					<p>Sam: What did you just do?</p>
					<p>Stella: I put lemon in my hair.  Lemon's good for hair.</p>
					<p>Sam: ... [this was the 30-second paralysis a coward's mind undergoes when his life is about to change forever] ...</p>
					<p>Stella: ...[this was 30 seconds of wondering, "Is he impressed? Is he confused? What's going on?"]</p>
					<p>Sam: Will you go out with me?</p>
					<p>Stella: Yes!</p>
				</div>
				<ul style="list-style:none;">
					<li>
						<%= image_tag "ourStory2.jpg", :class => "story2", :alt => "Heartland, land of hearts" %>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>That was November 3, 2009.</p> 

				<p>Sam finished school a month later and started working as a tour guide on the Freedom Trail.  Stella continued school and would pencil in time with Sam in between all her extracurricular activities. </p>

				<p>In January, 2011, they moved to Los Angeles together.</p>

				<p>Stella worked for a wine event start up and Sam parlayed an unpaid internship into his first paid TV gig.  Jobs came and went, Sam started doing yoga in the living room, Stella joined a yoga studio and got certified to teach; Sam wrote a few scripts, Stella freelanced a lot of events; Sam read a bunch of books, Stella obliged every time Sam asked, "Can I read this paragraph out loud to you? It's really something."</p>

				<p>On April 19, 2015, Sam proposed.  And on May 22, 2016, Sam and Stella will be married.</p>

				<p>They've come a long way from that second story vegan Thai restaurant in Boston's Chinatown.</p>   

				<p>Stella still puts lemon in her hair.  Sam does too.</p>
